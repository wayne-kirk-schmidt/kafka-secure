Kafka Secure
============

This repository looks to turn an Ubuntu server into a relatively hardened appliance. 

This will focus on file permissions, software packages, networking, SSH, and system configurations.

*   each of these sections will have a bash script that provides hardening for each of these areas

Installing the Scripts
=======================

The scripts are designed to be used within a batch script or DevOPs tool.

Where possible, the scripts use bash, and will not rely on any more sophisticated tools.

There are python based client tools for kafka, though they are to manage topics, groups, and partitions.

To install python into the build if not already installed, please perform the following steps:


    1. Download and install python 3.6 or higher from python.org. Append python3 to the LIB and PATH env.

    2. Download and install git for your platform if you don't already have it installed.
       It can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads
    
    3. Open a new shell/command prompt. It must be new since only a new shell will include the new python 
       path that was created in step 1. Change to the folder where you want to install the scripts.
    
    4. Execute the following command to install pipenv, which will manage all of the library dependencies:
    
        sudo -H pip3 install pipenv 
 
    5. Clone this repository. This will create a new folder
    
    6. Change into this folder. Type the following to install all the package dependencies 
       (this may take a while as this will download all of the libraries it uses):

        pipenv install
        
Dependencies
============

Script Names and Purposes
=========================

The scripts are organized into sub directories:

    1. ./bin - has all of the scripts here

    2. ./doc - this has reference information

    3. ./etc - this contains any specific configuration files required
